## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flex - align items and justify-content



### What I learned

I learnt another way of representing colors: hsl, and hsla. 
I also learnt how to center a div both vertically and horizontally. 



```css
body {
    background-color: hsla(203, 59%, 67%, 0.4);
    /* width: 80vw;
    height: 90vh;
    margin-top: 5vh;
    margin-left: 10vw; */
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}

```



### Continued development

I would like to continue understanding the layering items in css. How to measure the width, height of items relative to their containers. 



### Useful resources

- [Freecodecamp - How to center a div](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-a-div-with-css/) - This helped me with centering the div for the card.
